This is a placeholder for the resume file.

In a real implementation, you would:
1. Place your actual PDF resume file in this public folder
2. Name it "resume-rudraksh-taya.pdf"
3. The download functionality will automatically serve this file

For now, the download button will attempt to download this file, but since it doesn't exist, 
it will open a new tab instead (fallback behavior).

To add your real resume:
1. Export your resume as a PDF
2. Name it "resume-rudraksh-taya.pdf"
3. Place it in the public/ folder
4. The download functionality will work automatically
